# codebuilds should now be considered obsolete

Unfortunately due to a few reasons (some good!  Official support! :-)), I am no longer able to actively maintain this repository.

1). Life events have left me with very little time to maintain these builds.

2). As Microsoft now produces native ARM builds of Visual Studio Code, they should be a much better idea for most users for an installation that is fully vendor supported.  A popular Libre option is VSCodium, which has support for many more configurations than this repository supports.

3). The support window has also now closed for the series of 32-bit ARM Chromebooks that were supported by these builds and fell through the cracks of native Linux App support on Chrome OS.  While these are still feasible devices, they should likely not be used with Chrome OS as their operating system due to the end of vendor support updates.  If installing Linux on these devices, the official Microsoft builds would still be a better option than the builds here, for the reasons mentioned above.

As a result please DO NOT create new installations based on these scripts, and consider switching to one of the above (better) options for a better supported upgrade path.
